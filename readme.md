# Cross platform Blazor Desktop App

This sample shows a Blazor Desktop (using the offical APIs coming in .NET 6) app running in both a web browser and in a WinForms and WPF wrapper. This uses the default Blazor Server template as an example which is a bit prettier than the one on the .NET 6 Preview 2 announcement post.
